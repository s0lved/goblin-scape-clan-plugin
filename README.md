# Goblin Scape Clan Plugin
A plugin used to track clan activites for Goblin Scape Clan members. This is so we can track collection logs, achievements, word location, and many more things for the clan. The API is linked to the clan website where we can view this information. 

If you aren't part of the Goblin Scape clan, this plugin will most likely be useless to you. 

Goblin Scape members must use the correct URL and API key for this plugin to work.
